# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this project was to use deep-learning neural networks with the TensorFlow library in Python to help analyze and predict the risk of donation recipients from the Alphabet Soup nonprofit organization. 

## Results
### Data Preprocessing
- We began by cleaning the data and removing the `EIN`and `NAME` columns since they are identification information and add no value to the model
- The following columns `APPLICATION_TYPE` `AFFILIATION` `CLASSIFICATION` `USE_CASE` `ORGANIZATION` `STATUS` `INCOME_AMT` `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS` `ASK_AMT` are the features for our model. The features have been split into training and testing datasets and standardized.
- The `IS_SUCCESSFUL` column contains binary data on whether a charity donation was used effectively and is thus considered the target for the deep learning neural network.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
